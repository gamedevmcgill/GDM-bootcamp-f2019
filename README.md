# GameDev McGill Boot Camp
## GDM-bootcamp-f2019
5-6 week long boot camp teaching university students the basics of game development and programming.\
Heavily based off of the Brackey's RPG tutorial. Made in Unity 3D with C\# and Sebastian Lague's Blender models.

## Set Up

1. On command line\
`git clone https://github.com/gamedevmcgill/GDM-bootcamp-f2019.git`

2. Within the GDM Bootcamp RPG folder, checkout the branch that has the episode you want to view.\
The last episode should have the full tutorial result.\
In command line, X is the episode number corresponding to the Brackey's tutorial episodes.\
`git checkout episodeX`

3. Open Unity Hub and click Add.

4. Select the GDM Bootcamp RPG folder on your computer from cloning.

5. Use the Unity version (or similar version) written next to the added project, then click on that project panel to open in Unity.

For more information on how to use, debug, build, and play in Unity, check out their website: https://unity.com/.

If some of the assets do not appear, they made be .blend files, which can only be viewed if you have Blender installed.\
Both Blender and Unity are free though!

6. (optional)\
Do not want to download Blender pre-2.8 version? Here is the environment and player as fbx files with the fixed animation issues caused by Blender 2.8+\
Drag and drop the fbx edition unitypackage into your Unity project.\
